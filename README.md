Description:

Raven is a bit like that swallow-savvy guard in *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*'s opening scene: argument- and tangent-loving, and can be pretty dang funny. She enjoys (in no particular order) wordplay, debating semantics with [@ShadowProtocol](https://github.com/ShadowProtocol) and others (donut NOT doughnut!), references/easter eggs, trivia, bugging [@AshersLab](https://github.com/asherslab) about the quarry, playing Master of Orion II, bike riding, blaming [@Wissi](https://github.com/wissi), the webcomic [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/), [r/ProgrammerHumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/), *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*, *Artemis Fowl*, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes, recursion jokes...

She works as the [wiki](https://wiki.minecolonies.ldtteam.com/) admin and [customer service](https://discord.minecolonies.com) for the [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) mod [MineColonies](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/minecolonies), and also makes a few small edits to [the mod itself](https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies/issues) (mainly to [en_us.json](https://github.com/ldtteam/minecolonies/blob/version/1.15/src/main/resources/assets/minecolonies/lang/en_us.json)) as well as doing random odd jobs for the [LDT team](https://github.com/ldtteam). (If that sentence was any indication, she puts way too many links in the wiki!)

She has an ever-present case of staircase wit, which caused her to add this sentence in the first place.

And I think it's uncomfortable writing (typing?) about myself in the third person!
